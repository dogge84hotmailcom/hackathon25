                <h3>Why I chose Chas and Javascript</h3>
                <p>I love helping poeple with anyhting I can. So far it has mostly been about helping them find the perfect 
                    seat for a concert with classical music or opera. A seat where you can see the hands of the pianist 
                    while keeping a distance to the brass section. Now I want to help them navigate through a website instead,
                    but also to help the company that supplies the website. Help the user and the owner connect with me as an intermediary. 
                    Also, I want to do something that challenges me more.
                    <br><br>
                    Which leads me to my Javascript journey: I like the ability to do both frontend and backend 
                    in the same language, plus the user friendly syntax and availability that Javascript offers.
                    I chose Chas for the good reputation, the friendly faces in the broschure and for walking distance.

                <h3>My future profession</h3>
                <p>I want to start out as a junior developer that codes a lot, preferably as fullstack and with opportunity to get my own accounts. 
                    Would also love to teach what I have learned to others, and to become the best in the world at...anything in CSS 🤔
